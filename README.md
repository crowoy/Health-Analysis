# Health-Analysis
Tool for visualising and analysing personal fitness data.

The tools for displaying data from the Jawbone fitness trackers is great, and very intuitive. However, I wanted to create a tool to analyse the raw data in greater depth.

Thankfully, Jawbone allows you to download all of your raw data at the click of a button on their website, which includes your data over `78` tracked features.

### Dependencies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Jawbone Data

### How-to
- Install dependencies
- Download/clone this repository
- Move the download into its own folder (e.g. `/Health/Analysis`)
- Create a separate data folder (e.g. `/Health/Data`) and place your Jawbone data in here
- Now run Jupyter and open the notebook and run the program!
